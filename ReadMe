This is an early project of mine that I coded in high school. When Window.java is run it creates a graphic interface
from there you can enter the titles of two wikipedia pages, and the calculator will determine the number of hyperlinks 
to go from the first page to the second. However, because it is poorly optimized (it uses DFS instead of BFS), 
the fewer max hops you set the search to, the faster results will be generated. (v1.0)
